# Advent of Code
This repo is a collection of my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) -- an annual Advent Calendar of programming Puzzles

My goal is to eventually complete each day as it realeases for the active year, and I would like to eventually revisit past years.

I will provide a solution in Python by default, but also enjoy trying to do days in alternative languages, including the occasional solution in an [esoteric language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language)
